Multiple Model Kalman Temporal Differences (MM-KTD) framework for value function approximation.

This repository contains the codes for the MM-KTD framwork, introduced in the paper:

Multiple Model Kalman Temporal Differences for Reinforcement Learning (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00195.pdf)

Figs directory includes all of the figures in the paper.

gym-foo directory is a fork from https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/docs/creating-environments.md.

For the Inverted Pendulum experiment, run Inverted_Pendulum.py in the MM-KTD codes directory. 

For the Lunar Lander experiment, run Lunar_lander.py in the MM-KTD codes directory. 

For the Mountain Car experiment, run Mountain_Car.py in the MM-KTD codes directory.
